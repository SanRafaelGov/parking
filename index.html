					<h1 class="title">What's Important?</h1>
					<p class="tagline">It's Better For Everyone.</p>
					<p class="lead">The City of San Rafael, <strong><em>using the new parking sensors</em></strong>, can now collect and utilize information related to transporation and parking -- making better, more informed decisions in the policy making process.</p>
					<p><strong>First</strong>, the question the Citizens of the City of San Rafael have to ask <em>“Is the current transporation and parking policy the best policy?”</em></p> 
					<p><em>A policy that best serves its citizens, businesses and organizations?</em></p>
					<p>If the answer is <em>“No. We can craft a better parking/transportation policy.”</em> then we have to ask ourselves, <strong>as a community</strong>, what are the best steps for crafting a better parking and transportation policy?</p><hr>
					<p class="lead text-center">“<strong>Government should be transparent.</strong> Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.”<br><span class="text-right"><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOpenGovernment" target="_blank"><small>-WhiteHouse.gov</small></a></span></p><hr>
					<p>Surprisingly, a step that is often overlooked in the public policy decision making process, is asking ourselves what <strong><em>information and data</em></strong> is available to us and how can we better understand that information, so the public policy we vote into law is informed, factual and accurate.</p>
					<p>Thankfully, with the emergence of the Internet (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age" target="_blank">Era of Information</a>) and readily available (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" target="_blank">Open Source</a>) technologies we can more quickly and efficiently incorporate, analyze and understand mountains of data, so when it’s time to draft public policies we can do so with an accurate map.</p>
					<p>In other words, as more information and data becomes available to Citizens and Governments, we can begin making informed, data-driven decisions, based off of real-world information. Pretty cool huh ;)</p>
					<h3 class="tagline">The Power of Information &amp; Analytics</h3>
					<p>The City of San Rafael new parking policy is $1.50/hr, but how can we tell if the current policy is the best policy? Well… until recently, it was actually kind of difficult to quantify and measure the current policy, because it would take an enormous amount of resources to gather the information -- let alone analyze the data and understand it in a meaningful way.</p>
					<p>That being said, now that a majority <em>(citation needed)</em> of the paid street parking spots in the City of San Rafael are equipped with sensors, we can now much more easily <em>(compared to the pre-sensor era)</em> analyze the results of current policy and see what’s working, what’s not working and what we can change to work better.</p>
					<p><strong>Below are several examples of different policies to demonstrate the idea of A/B testing.</strong></p>
					<p>Now that data is being collected we can actually test different parking policies and analyze the data to see what policy is best for <strong>Citizens, Shoppers, Businesses and Organizations.</strong></p>

					<h3 class="tagline">Tell Us What You Think</h3>
					<p>Together we can create public policies that are better for everyone, but to start the process we first have to understand each other. Fill out the survey and tell us your thoughts on the transportation and parking policies in the City of San Rafael.</p>
					<ol>
						<li><p><em>Have an idea about how we can make parking better for downtown businesses?</em></p></li>
						<li><p><em>Do you think the data collected using public funds should be made available in usable formats?</em></p></li>
						<li><p><em>Are you discouraged from shopping in San Rafael, because it’s a hassle to find parking?</em></p></li>
					</ol>
					<p>Let us know in the survey -- <strong>We're going to share the results with the City of San Rafael.</strong></p>

					<h1 class="title">A Public Repository</h1>
					<p class="tagline">Sharing Resources</p>
					<p>The <strong>GitHub repository</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/SanRafaelGov/parking" target="_blank">https://github.com/SanRafaelGov/parking</a>) will be used to store information, documents and resources. People can quickly download material (<em>once they're available</em>) and also contribute to the project by creating a pull request.</p>
					<p>A GitHub repository is used by developers, so they can collaboratively write code and freely share their solutions with the world.</p>
					<div class="video">
						<iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/CEN4XNth61o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div>
					<p>That being said, it's also a really incredibly powerful tool for other areas (<em>Civic Engagement</em>), because you can freely store documents, resources, etc... and everyone easily make get involved, create pull requests and participate in the development of the repository.</p>
					<p><strong>What's a pull request?</strong></p>
					<p>Pull requests are commonly used by teams and organizations collaborating using the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#article-platform-nav" target="_blank">Shared Repository Model</a>, where everyone contributor shares a single repository and branches are used to develop features and isolate changes. </p>
					<p>Many Open Source projects on Github use pull requests to manage changes from contributors as they are useful in providing a way to notify project maintainers about changes one has made and in initiating <em>*code review*</em> and <strong>general discussion</strong> about a set of changes before being merged into the main branch.</p>
					<p>In others words it’s a really powerful tool to collaborate on projects and it’s not just for developers anymore!</p>

					<p class="lead">Hello. My name is Kames C.G. and I'm a front-end developer for Launch1000, who likes to participate in Civic Engagement opportunities (I wish I participated more).</p>
					<p>I came to realize the parking in downtown San Rafael has become a very important discussion topic for a lot people: businesses, citizens, organizations, etc…, because it affects so many areas of our lives.</p>
					<p>When the credit card readers and sensors first arrived I thought to myself <em>"Great! Just another way to ticket more people -- faster"</em>, but soon after the realization I thought to myself <em>“All of the information that's being gathered (potentially stored) could actually be used in a lot of really interesting ways. We could make better public policy decisions and also help foster an informed public discussion, because we could look at hard data and find out what's working and what's not.”</em></p>
					<p><strong>Are you interested in San Rafael Parking discussion?</strong></p>
					<p>I happily invite you to sign-up for the email newsletter -- With enough interest I would like to facilitate a community discussion (online and real-world) about how we, as Citizen can better utilize data and information to make smarter public policy decisions.</p>
