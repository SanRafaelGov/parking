Public Discussion About Data

What's Interesting About San Rafael's New Parking Meters
--------------------------------------------------------

The San Rafael parking meters were recently equipped with new credit card readers and **sensors** that provide the ability to track when people park and how long they're staying. 

What does that mean? Why should we care? Can we do any interesting with the new technology?

Simply put, we can now collect accurate information of traffic flow -- making better, more informed decisions, which can guide smart policy decisions. The best part is we can do **really** interesting things with that information(data visualation, factual community discussions and other civil pursuits).  



###Project Page
Visit http://sanrafaelgov.github.io/parking to participate in an online survey and become familiar with the project.


###Public Repository
The GitHub repository(the page you're currently view) will be used store information, documents and resources. People can quickly download material(once they're available) and also contribute by creating a pull-request.

The surveys results hosted on the project page will be posted with factual annotation.

A GitHub repository is usally employed by developers, so they collaboratively write code together and share freely their solutions with the world. That being said, it's also a really incredible tool for other niche uses(like civic engagement), because you freely store documents, resources, etc... and everyone can make pull-requsts. 

What's a pull-request? It means anyone can make a public contribution, which can be either accepted or denied by the repostiory owner.

###About
Hello. My name is Kames C.G. and I'm a front-end developer, who likes to participate in Civic engagement every once'awhile(I wish I participate more). I've come to realize the parking in down-town San Rafael has become an issue for a lot people: businsesses, citizens, shoppers, etc...

When the credit card readers and sensors first arrived I thought to myself "Great! Just another way to ticket more people faster", but than I realized all of the information that's being gathered(potentially stored) could actually be used in a lot of interesting ways to make better public policy decisions and help foster an informed public discussion, because we could look at hard data and find out what's working and what's not.

Interested in San Rafael Parking discussion? I invite you to please sign-up for the email list. If there enough interest we can have a community discussion about what public data means about making informed policy decisions. 

If you want to get involved in the project email directly at SanRafaelGov@gmail.com
