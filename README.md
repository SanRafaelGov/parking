What's Interesting About San Rafael's New Parking Meters

The San Rafael parking meters were recently equipped with new credit card readers and **sensors** that provide the ability to track when people park and how long they're staying. 

What does that mean? Why should we care? Can we do any interesting with the new technology?

Simply put, we can now collect accurate information of traffic flow -- making better, more informed decisions, which can guide smart policy decisions. The best part is we can do **really** interesting things with that information(data visualation, factual community discussions and other civil pursuits).
